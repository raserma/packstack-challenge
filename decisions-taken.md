# Decisions Taken on the challenge
This file describes the reasons why I decided to go on a specific direction.
I will try to collect only the important choices taken. I have four evenings
to finish the challenge, therefore time is a constant to take into account.


Once that I got the challenge from Richard, I started studying the tasks and
requirements. We need to use Vagrant to deploy Openstack with POC tool called
Packstack. I never used it before but I have had used DevStack so I guessed
it would be similar. 
An ansible project must be created, with a role to automate openstack 
operations and a playbook to orchestrate VMs creation. Input to these ops must
be on YAML format.
Finally, I need to create a dynamic inventory in ansible to query environment
information and group VMs based on attributes.

## Decision 00
Before to start deploying anything, I check the files of the project:
 - Vagrantfile: recipe used by Vagrant to spin Centos up and execute Packstack.
 - answers.txt: recipe used by Packstack to spin OST environment up.

Going through the Vagrantfile, on line #31, packstack needs answers.txt, and 
this file is not added anywhere on the Vagrantfile, Vagrant will fail.

Going through answers.txt, on line #32, Nova component appears as "n", which
means that will not be installed. This is definitely the second step fix.

## Decision 01
 * Git workflow to use: on the first steps, I will be commiting and pushing
on the master branch, as it is easier and faster for me. There is no CI in
place nor collaboration with other people needed. Therefore, I have taken
the decision to only push to `master` for now. If situation changes, I will
adapt.

## Decision 02
 * Install pre-commit githook: I am going to be working with Ansible a lot, 
therefore I want to be sure that my code is Lint compliant and syntax clean. 
I could set a .travis.yml file for that but I have not used Travis before and
it is too much work for the same results. Also, I am not collaborating with
anyone so integration is not much needed at this point.
For that, I installed a pre-commit hook on the repository, so it is triggered 
before commiting a change. 

## Decision 03
 * Add infrastructure tests: I am going to use Ansible to modify the state
of OST environment, therefore I need to test the infrastructure deployments.
I am not sure yet which tool/platform to use for this matters as I am not very
familiart with OST. Also, it is not a mandatory task, so I will not waste all 
my time here. Something simple and effective should work.

## Decision 04
 * Add vagrant ports to open connections with the guest. Added "forwarded
port" mapping 80:8080.

## Decision 05
 * Open the necessary ports in vagrant to allow a VM on the same network to 
access the API endpoints showed by issuing `$ openstack endpoint list 
--interface public`. I could simply change NAT to public_network in vagrant 
but that seems less secure. I cannot spend much more time here. Truth is,
I am not sure which way is the best, so I will just go for the way it works.
Also, if I am not wrong, a VM on the same subnet will not be able to access
any port in my Windows laptop unless I open the ports in the firewall.

## Decision 06
 * Use Ansible instead of AWX: considering my experience with AWX and the
tasks that need to be done, this project fits quite well with AWX. Specially
the dynamic inventory querying information from Openstack environment. 
However, I decided to execute them on Ansible standalone as I am not 100% 
certain how to deploy correctly AWX on Packstack and time is not in my favor.
On the other side, I will create the role and playbooks taking into account
that could be migrated to AWX for a future project, if needed.

## Decision 07
 * using one role instead of modularity: I decided to use one role instead
 of many because the exercise said so. However, the more I am developing,
 the more I regret not adding more granularity to the roles.

## Decision 08
 * import_role and from_tasks: because I was using one only role, and I was
never a friend of tags, I decided to use latest feature `import_role` and 
call the tasks separately. Probably not the best decision ever.

## Decision 09
 * vars_files to include vars: because the requirements said to use a YML file,
 I am using vars_files for that. 

## Decision 10
 * I am aware that I am doing things wrong. It is too late to come back. If
 I was working without so much time pressure, I would change mostly everything:
 how to deal with roles, how to deal with vars, the main playbook, etc.

## Decision 11
 * I cannot SSH/login into the VMs from packstack. I have tried everything, I am not sure what I am missing. I will keep going and focus on the last task
 as I cannot get stuck longer here. Tic tac.

## Decision 12
 * dynamic inventory: I have worked with VMware dynamic inventory and Ansible
 Tower but I have never used Openstack one. I know there is an official dynamic
 inventory and I will check that one as I have barely 3 hours left to finish
 last task.
